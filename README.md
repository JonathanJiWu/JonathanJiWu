Aspiring Software Engineer with full-stack development and hardware experience.
Introspective, articulate and enthusiastic, I energize the office with curiosity, introspective thinking and bits of enjoyments I find in daily life; making meaningful progress is my prized ambition.

I'm a verbal thinker who loves meeting people and always looking for systematic, cost-effect and scalable ways to solve problems.
A lifelong learner with experience in management, marketing, education, nonprofit and tech, currently pursuing software engineering.
